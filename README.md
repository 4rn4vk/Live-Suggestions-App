# Live Suggestions — AI Meeting Copilot

A real-time AI meeting copilot that listens to your microphone and continuously surfaces three contextually relevant suggestions while you talk.

## Stack

| Layer | Choice | Why |
|---|---|---|
| Framework | Next.js 16 (App Router) | Co-locates client and server; API routes eliminate an extra backend service |
| Language | TypeScript | End-to-end type safety |
| Styling | Tailwind CSS v4 | Fast, co-located design tokens |
| Transcription | Groq Whisper Large V3 | Best-in-class open-source ASR, extremely low latency on Groq |
| LLM | Groq (model configurable, default: `openai/gpt-oss-120b`) | GPT-OSS 120B — matches spec requirement; configurable via Settings |
| Deployment | Vercel | Zero-config Next.js hosting |

## Setup

```bash
# 1. Install dependencies
npm install

# 2. Start dev server
npm run dev
# → http://localhost:3000
```

No `.env` needed — the Groq API key is entered through the in-app Settings modal, stored in `sessionStorage` (cleared when the tab closes), and synced to an HTTP-only session cookie via `/api/set-key` so API routes read the key from the cookie and it never travels in a request body.

## How it works

```
Mic → 30-second WebM chunks → /api/transcribe (Whisper Large V3)
                                      ↓
                              Transcript state (client)
                                      ↓
Every 30 s (or manual refresh) → /api/suggestions → 3 suggestion cards
                                      ↓
User clicks card → /api/expand → streaming detailed answer → Chat panel
User types message → /api/chat  → streaming LLM reply      → Chat panel
```

## Prompt Strategy

### Live Suggestions (`/api/suggestions`)

**Goal:** Surface the 3 most immediately useful things in context.

**Context window:** Last 3,000 characters of transcript (configurable). This is enough for ~90 s of speech — recent enough to be relevant, small enough to stay fast.

**Type system:** Each suggestion is tagged with one of five kinds:
- `question` — a sharp follow-up question the user could ask right now  
- `talking_point` — an argument or data point the speaker hasn't raised  
- `answer` — a direct answer to a question just posed in the transcript  
- `fact_check` — verification or correction of a specific claim  
- `clarification` — plain-language explanation of a term or concept  

**Why five kinds instead of one?** Real conversations need different help at different moments. If someone just asked a hard question, the most useful thing is an `answer`. If they've been talking without evidence, a `fact_check` is more valuable. The model is instructed to pick the mix that fits the current moment — not always one of each.

**Preview quality constraint:** The prompt explicitly requires the `preview` (25-word max) to deliver standalone value without clicking. This ensures cards aren't clickbait.

**Temperature:** 0.7 — enough creativity to avoid repetitive suggestions, controlled enough to stay grounded.

### Expanded Answer (`/api/expand`)

**Context window:** Last 8,000 characters of transcript. Clicking deserves richer context.

**Temperature:** 0.5 — more deterministic; the user expects a reliable, grounded answer.

**Prompt:** Passes `kind` + `preview` so the model knows what the user selected and can tailor the depth and format (structured list vs prose).

### Chat (`/api/chat`)

**System prompt:** Instructs the model to cite transcript content, prefer structured responses for complex questions, and give direct opinions when asked.

**User message:** Each turn prepends the recent transcript as `[Transcript context]` before `[User question]`. This means every question has full context without stuffing the system prompt every time.

**Streaming:** All LLM responses stream via `ReadableStream` — first token appears in <400 ms on Groq.

## Tradeoffs & Decisions

| Decision | Rationale |
|---|---|
| API key in HTTP-only session cookie | Stored in `sessionStorage` client-side, synced to an HTTP-only cookie via `/api/set-key`; request bodies never carry the key. |
| Audio chunked with `requestData()` every 30 s | Avoids holding a full session blob in memory; matches the transcript cadence |
| Suggestions auto-fire on the same interval as audio chunks | Everything stays in lockstep — refresh = new transcript + new suggestions |
| No vector DB / embedding search | Transcript fits comfortably in a single LLM context window for session lengths realistic for interviews |
| Batches stack newest-first | Most actionable suggestions are always visible above the fold |
| Streaming for expand + chat | Latency perception is critical; streaming gives sub-second first-token feel |

## Deploying to Vercel

```bash
npm i -g vercel
vercel --prod
```

No environment variables needed — the Groq key is user-supplied at runtime.
